## üåü Key Features

- **Accurate Image Analysis:**  
  This CNN model, honed with a diverse dataset of 1190 CT scan images from 110 cases, efficiently processes and classifies lung images resized to 256x256 pixels.

- **Interactive Chatbot Assistant:**  
  The integrated LLaMA3-based chatbot is designed to offer clear, compassionate, and knowledgeable responses, making it a valuable resource for both patients and medical professionals.

- **Sleek & Responsive UI:**  
  Built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS, the web interface is designed for simplicity and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## üîç How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - CT scan images are normalized and resized for uniformity.
   - Techniques like grayscale conversion and blur addition enhance image details.
   - Advanced methods, such as class weighting, balance the data for robust model training.

2. **Model Training & Evaluation:**  
   - The CNN model is rigorously trained and validated, achieving outstanding performance.
   - Two approaches were explored: SMOTE oversampling and class weighting. The latter was chosen for its stability and consistency.

3. **Real-Time Deployment:**  
   - ParuAI is hosted on Hugging Face and runs within a Docker container, making it ready for real-world application with just a few commands.
